## What’s This About?
I’ve broken down Figma into bite-sized lessons:
- **Components**: Craft a reusable **Primary Button** (so cool, right?).  
- **Layouts**: Design sleek screens with Auto Layout magic.  
- **Prototyping**: Make buttons clickable with smooth animations.  
- **Extras**: A Glossary for terms and Troubleshooting for hiccups.

Perfect for newbies, students, or anyone mocking up their next big idea!
