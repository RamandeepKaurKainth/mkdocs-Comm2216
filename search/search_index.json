Assets Panel The left sidebar tab in Figma where reusable components (e.g., your <code>Primary Button</code>) are stored for dragging onto the canvas. Auto Layout A Figma feature that automatically adjusts spacing and positioning of elements within a frame (e.g., a button and its text), activated with <code>Shift + A</code>. Component A reusable design element in Figma (e.g., a button or icon) that you create once and use multiple times. Changes to the main component update all instances. Fill The color or gradient applied to a shape or text in Figma, adjustable in the right sidebar\u2019s properties panel (e.g., <code>#007BFF</code> for a blue button). Frame A container in Figma where you design screens or layouts (e.g., an <code>iPhone 13</code> screen). It\u2019s like an artboard and supports <code>Auto Layout</code>. Instance A copy of a component linked to its main version. You can tweak its properties (e.g., text), but structural changes come from the master component. Layers Panel The left sidebar in Figma listing all elements (e.g., shapes, text) on your canvas, used to select, rename, or organize items. Overlay A special prototype feature in Figma for adding pop-ups or modals that appear over the main screen, configured in the <code>Prototype</code> tab. Present The button in Figma\u2019s top-right corner (play icon) that lets you preview your design or prototype interactively. Prototype An interactive version of your design in Figma, created by linking frames with actions (e.g., clicking a button to move to another screen). Prototype Node A small circular dot that appears on interactive elements in <code>Prototype</code> mode, dragged to link frames or set interactions. Rectangle Tool (R) A <code>Toolbar</code> option in Figma for drawing rectangular shapes (e.g., a <code>200x50px</code> button), used as a building block for UI elements. Smart Animate A Figma prototyping animation that smoothly transitions between frames by matching similar elements, set in the interaction settings. Text Tool (T) A <code>Toolbar</code> option in Figma for adding and editing text (e.g., <code>\"Click Me\"</code> on a button), with font options in the right sidebar. Toolbar The top bar in Figma containing tools like <code>Frame (F)</code>, <code>Rectangle (R)</code>, and <code>Text (T)</code> for creating and editing your design."},{"location":"prototyping/","title":"Prototyping a Button Interaction","text":""},{"location":"prototyping/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Prototyping in Figma turns your static designs into interactive experiences.

Ensure you\u2019ve selected the <code>Frame Tool (F)</code> from the <code>Toolbar</code>. In the right sidebar, under <code>\"W\"</code> and <code>\"H\"</code>, click the dropdown for presets like <code>iPhone 13</code>. Component Doesn\u2019t Appear in Assets Panel Component wasn\u2019t properly created or the Assets tab isn\u2019t active. Check the <code>Layers Panel</code> for a blue diamond icon. Switch to the <code>Assets</code> tab (next to <code>Layers</code>) or restart Figma if it\u2019s still missing. Auto Layout Won\u2019t Adjust Button and Text Together Elements aren\u2019t grouped or not inside a frame with <code>Auto Layout</code> enabled. Select the rectangle and text, group them (<code>Ctrl + G</code> or <code>Cmd + G</code>), then apply <code>Auto Layout</code> (<code>Shift + A</code>) to the frame. Adjust padding in the right sidebar. Prototype Link Doesn\u2019t Trigger on Click No interaction set or the link wasn\u2019t connected in <code>Prototype</code> mode. Switch to the <code>Prototype</code> tab, select the button, drag the <code>Prototype Node</code> to the destination frame, set <code>\"On Click\"</code>, and test with <code>Present</code>. Changes to Component Don\u2019t Update Instances Editing an instance instead of the master component, or instance was detached. Edit the master component (blue outline in <code>Layers Panel</code>). If detached, recreate the instance from the Assets Panel. Shapes Disappear When Moving Them Shape moved outside the visible canvas or behind another frame. Check the Layers Panel to locate it. Use the <code>Move Tool</code> (V) and arrow keys to nudge it back into view. Text Size or Font Won\u2019t Change Text layer isn\u2019t in edit mode or overridden by a component instance. Double-click the text with the <code>Text Tool (T)</code> to edit, then adjust in the right sidebar. Check for instance overrides and reset if needed. Smart Animate Looks Choppy or Doesn\u2019t Work Mismatched layer names or too many complex effects between frames. Ensure elements have the same name in both frames. Simplify by reducing shadows or gradients. Overlay Won\u2019t Center in Prototype <code>Overlay</code> position not set or misconfigured in <code>Prototype</code> settings. In the <code>Prototype</code> tab, select the overlay frame, choose <code>\"Overlay\"</code>, and set position to <code>\"Center\"</code> or adjust <code>X/Y</code> coordinates manually.
