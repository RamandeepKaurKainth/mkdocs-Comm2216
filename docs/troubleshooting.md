# Troubleshooting Guide

Below is a table of common issues you might face while following this Figma User Guide for Beginners, along with their causes and solutions:

| Issue                                | Cause                                                                 | Solution                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frame Tool Doesn’t Show Presets Like iPhone 13** | Using the wrong tool or missing the preset dropdown in the properties panel. | Ensure you’ve selected the `Frame Tool (F)` from the `Toolbar`. In the right sidebar, under `"W"` and `"H"`, click the dropdown for presets like `iPhone 13`. |
| **Component Doesn’t Appear in Assets Panel** | Component wasn’t properly created or the Assets tab isn’t active.    | Check the `Layers Panel` for a blue diamond icon. Switch to the `Assets` tab (next to `Layers`) or restart Figma if it’s still missing. |
| **Auto Layout Won’t Adjust Button and Text Together** | Elements aren’t grouped or not inside a frame with `Auto Layout` enabled. | Select the rectangle and text, group them (`Ctrl + G` or `Cmd + G`), then apply `Auto Layout` (`Shift + A`) to the frame. Adjust padding in the right sidebar. |
| **Prototype Link Doesn’t Trigger on Click** | No interaction set or the link wasn’t connected in `Prototype` mode.   | Switch to the `Prototype` tab, select the button, drag the `Prototype Node` to the destination frame, set `"On Click"`, and test with `Present`. |
| **Changes to Component Don’t Update Instances** | Editing an instance instead of the master component, or instance was detached. | Edit the master component (blue outline in `Layers Panel`). If detached, recreate the instance from the Assets Panel. |
| **Shapes Disappear When Moving Them** | Shape moved outside the visible canvas or behind another frame.      | Check the Layers Panel to locate it. Use the `Move Tool` (V) and arrow keys to nudge it back into view. |
| **Text Size or Font Won’t Change**   | Text layer isn’t in edit mode or overridden by a component instance. | Double-click the text with the `Text Tool (T)` to edit, then adjust in the right sidebar. Check for instance overrides and reset if needed. |
| **Smart Animate Looks Choppy or Doesn’t Work** | Mismatched layer names or too many complex effects between frames.   | Ensure elements have the same name in both frames. Simplify by reducing shadows or gradients.     |
| **Overlay Won’t Center in Prototype** | `Overlay` position not set or misconfigured in `Prototype` settings.     | In the `Prototype` tab, select the overlay frame, choose `"Overlay"`, and set position to `"Center"` or adjust `X/Y` coordinates manually. |
| **Can’t Share Prototype Link**       | File permissions not set or unsaved changes preventing sharing.      | Set permissions to `"Anyone with the link can view"` (`Share` button). Save the file first, then regenerate the link or QR code. |
