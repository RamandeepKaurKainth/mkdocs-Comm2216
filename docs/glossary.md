# Glossary

Here are key terms you’ll encounter in this Figma User Guide for Beginners, presented in a table for easy reference:

| Term              | Definition                                                                                          |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Align Tools**   | Options in Figma’s `Toolbar` (e.g., `Align Left`, `Center`, or `Vertically`) to neatly position multiple selected elements, like buttons and text. |
| **Assets Panel**  | The left sidebar tab in Figma where reusable components (e.g., your `Primary Button`) are stored for dragging onto the canvas. |
| **Auto Layout**   | A Figma feature that automatically adjusts spacing and positioning of elements within a frame (e.g., a button and its text), activated with `Shift + A`. |
| **Component**     | A reusable design element in Figma (e.g., a button or icon) that you create once and use multiple times. Changes to the main component update all instances. |
| **Fill**          | The color or gradient applied to a shape or text in Figma, adjustable in the right sidebar’s properties panel (e.g., `#007BFF` for a blue button). |
| **Frame**         | A container in Figma where you design screens or layouts (e.g., an `iPhone 13` screen). It’s like an artboard and supports `Auto Layout`. |
| **Instance**      | A copy of a component linked to its main version. You can tweak its properties (e.g., text), but structural changes come from the master component. |
| **Layers Panel**  | The left sidebar in Figma listing all elements (e.g., shapes, text) on your canvas, used to select, rename, or organize items. |
| **Overlay**       | A special prototype feature in Figma for adding pop-ups or modals that appear over the main screen, configured in the `Prototype` tab. |
| **Present**       | The button in Figma’s top-right corner (play icon) that lets you preview your design or prototype interactively. |
| **Prototype**     | An interactive version of your design in Figma, created by linking frames with actions (e.g., clicking a button to move to another screen). |
| **Prototype Node**| A small circular dot that appears on interactive elements in `Prototype` mode, dragged to link frames or set interactions. |
| **Rectangle Tool (R)** | A `Toolbar` option in Figma for drawing rectangular shapes (e.g., a `200x50px` button), used as a building block for UI elements. |
| **Smart Animate** | A Figma prototyping animation that smoothly transitions between frames by matching similar elements, set in the interaction settings. |
| **Text Tool (T)** | A `Toolbar` option in Figma for adding and editing text (e.g., `"Click Me"` on a button), with font options in the right sidebar. |
| **Toolbar**       | The top bar in Figma containing tools like `Frame (F)`, `Rectangle (R)`, and `Text (T)` for creating and editing your design. |
