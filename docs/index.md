# Figma User Guide For Beginners

## Introduction

Welcome! :raised_hand:  
This documentation will guide you through using [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/), a cloud-based design tool, to create user interfaces and interactive prototypes for small to medium scale projects. The aim is to provide a clear, step-by-step structure that breaks down Figma's features into manageable tasks, emphasizing best practices for designing collaboratively or solo. Whether you are mocking up a website or prototyping an app, this guide has you covered.

>[**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/) is a browser-based design and prototyping platform that allows real-time collaboration, making it perfect for creating wireframes, UI designs, and interactive mockups. It runs entirely in the cloud, so your work is accessible anywhere.
>
>**Why use Figma?** It streamlines the design process with intuitive tools and team-friendly features, ideal for personal projects or group workflows.

## Intended Users

This guide is targeted towards the following users:

- **Beginner to intermediate designers** who want to design a UI or prototype for a personal project.
- **Student teams or small groups** working on collaborative design assignments or mockups.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The documentation assumes the following:

- **Basic design skills** - you should understand simple layout concepts (e.g., spacing, alignment) and have some familiarity with tools like Canva or Sketch.
- **Ability to use a browser** - you're comfortable navigating websites and using basic shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl + C` to copy).
- **Figma basics** - you've signed up for a free [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/pricing/) and can log in (don’t worry if you haven’t, we’ll cover the setup!).

## Software Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **A modern web browser** (e.g., [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ)) with an internet connection.
- [**Figma account**](https://www.figma.com/signup) (free tier is fine – sign up at [figma.com](https://www.figma.com)).
- [**Optional: Figma desktop app**](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) (available for Mac/Windows, but the browser works too).
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (for managing this guide’s Markdown files, though any text editor works).

>Note: Screenshots will be from Figma’s browser version, but instructions apply to the desktop app too. Alternatives like Adobe XD or Sketch won’t work here – this is Figma-specific!

## Procedure Overview

The main sections of this guide are:

- Creating and Using Components in Figma
- Creating a Design Layout in Figma
- Prototyping a Button Interaction in Figma

Each section includes 10 steps, graphics, and tips to keep you on track.

## Typographical Conventions

Here’s how we’ll format things:

- **Code-like terms** (e.g., Rectangle Tool) indicate Figma tools or options.
- **File names** (e.g., MyFirstProject.fig) will look like this.
- **Browser Commands** will be styled like: `Ctrl + S` to save.
- **Numbered steps** use bolded **verbs** (e.g., **Click**, **Drag**) for clarity.
- Changes to designs will be **highlighted** in yellow in graphics or text, like:

- Original: A blue button (#007BFF).
- Updated: A darker blue button (#0056B3).
