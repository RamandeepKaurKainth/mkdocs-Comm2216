## Introduction

Welcome! :hand:
This documentation will guide you through using [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/), a cloud based design tool, to create user interfaces and interactive prototypes for small to medium scale projects. The aim is to provide a clear, step-by-step structure that breaks down Figma's features into manageable tasks, emphasizing best practices for designing collaboratively or solo. Whether you are mocking up a website or prototyping an app, this guide has you covered.

[**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/) is browser-based design and prototyping platform that allows real-time collabration, making it perfect for creating wireframes, UI designs, and interactive mockups. It runs entirely in the cloud, so your work is accessible anywhere.

**Why use Figma?** It streamlines the design process with intuitive tools and team-friendly features, ideal for personal projects or group workflows.

## Intended Users

This guide is targeted towards the following users:

* **Beginner to intermediate designers** who want to design a UI or prototype for a personal project.

* **Student teams or small groups** working on collaborative designs assignments or mockups.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The documentation assumes the following:

* **Basic design skills**- you should understand a simple layout concepts (e.g., spacing, alignment) and have some familiarity with tools like Canva's or Sketch.

* **Ability to use a browser**- you're comforatbale navigating websites and using basic shortcuts(e.g., Ctrl + C to copy).

* **Figma basics**- you've signed up for a Free [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/pricing/) and can log in (don't worry if you haven't, we'll cover the setup!).

## Software Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

* **A modern web browser** () (e.g., [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ) ) with an internet connection.

* [**Figma account**](https://www.figma.com/signup) (free tier is fine -- sign up at [figma.com](https://www.figma.com)).

* [**Optional: Figma desktop app**](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) (available for Mac/Windows, but browser works too).

* [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (for managing this guide's Markdown files, through any text editor works).

Note: Screenshots will be from Figma's browser version, but instructions appply to the deskyop app too. Alternatives like Adobe XD or Sketch won't work here - this is Figms-specific!

## Procedure Overview

The main sections of this guide are:

* Creating a Design Layout in Figma.
* Creating and Using Components in Figma.
* Prototyping a Button Interaction in Figma

Each section include 10 steps, graphics, and tips to keep you on track.

## Typographical Conventions

Here's how we'll format things:

* **Code-like terms** (e.g., Rectangle Tool) indicate Figma toold or options.

* **File names** (e.g., My First Project.fig) will look like this.

* **Browser Commands** will be styled like:

* **Numbered steps** use bolded **verbs** (e.g., **Click**, **Drag**) for clarity.

Changes to designs will be highlighted in yellow in graphics or text, like:

* Original: A blue button(##007BFF).
* Updated: A darker blue button (##0056B3).
